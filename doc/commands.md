## help

Display help message.

* `lc help <command>` to see help on sub command.
* `lc <command> --help` also works.

*Examples*

	$ lc help

	list [keyword]     list problems
	show <keyword>     show problem by name or index
	submit <filename>  submit final solution to leetcode
	test <filename>    send solution to leetcode and run test
	user               login/logout with leetcode account
	version            show version info

Show help on sub command:

	$ lc help list

	lc list [keyword]

	Options:
      --help       Show help                                               [boolean]
      --keyword    Filter problems by keyword                               [string]
      --query, -q  Filter problems by conditions:
                   e(easy),m(medium),h(hard),d(done),l(locked)
                   Uppercase means negative, e.g. D(not done)               [string]
      --stat, -s   Show problems statistics                                [boolean]

## list

Navigate all the problems. The heading `âœ”` means you have AC-ed the problem, `âœ˜` means not AC-ed.

* `-q` to query by conditions.
	* `e` = easy, `E` = m + h.
	* `m` = medium, `M` = e + h.
	* `h` = hard, `H` = e + m.
	* `d` = done = AC-ed, `D` = not AC-ed.
	* `l` = locked, `L` = not locked.
* `-s` to show statistic counters.
* `lc list <keyword>` to search by keyword matching.

## show

Display problem details. With `-g`+`-l`, the code template could be auto generated for you.

* `-g` to generate source file.
* `-l` to choose programming language. (Depends on which langs are provided on leetcode)
	* c
	* cpp
	* csharp
	* golang
	* java
	* javascript
	* python
	* ruby
	* swift
* Instead of index number, you can use name to select a problem.
	* `lc show "Two Sum"`
	* `lc show two-sum`

*Examples*

	$ lc show 1 -g -l cpp

    [1] Two Sum    	(File: two-sum.cpp)

    https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

    * Easy (25.6%)
    * Total Accepted: 274880
    * Total Submissions: 1074257
    * Testcase Example:  '[3,2,4]\n6'

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    Example:

    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].

    UPDATE (2016/2/13):
    The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.

## submission

Retrieve your existing submissions from leetcode.com and save to local files.

* For AC-ed problem, the last accepted submission will be retrieved, which output in green color.
* For non AC-ed problem, the last non-accepted submission will be retrieved, which output in yellow.
* If the submission file already exists in local, it will skip retrieving and output in white.

Available options:

* `-o` to specify the output folder.
* `-a` to work against all problems.
* Or work against specfic problem only.
	* `lc submission 1`
	* `lc submission two-sum`


*Examples*
